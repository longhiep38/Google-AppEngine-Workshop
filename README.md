Google App Engine - Workshop
===================================

This project is meant for any Java Developer to get going with [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/), the popular PaaS from Google. 

This project contains the Presentation, App Engine Projects and Hands-on Exercises for App Engine Workshop, that is planned for BITS Pilani (Goa) Quark Tech Fest. The workshop is being held in association with Google Developer Group (Goa).

Contents of the respective directories:

- In the main folder, you will find the presentation. The files are available in 3 formats : Powerpoint .pptx, .ppt file and PDF.
- `hands-on-exercises` : This contains several PDF documents, which are explained here:
 
 - `From Scratch - Google App Engine Development Environment Setup.pdf`: Follow this document first to setup your development environment for Google App Engine. At a high level, the document instructs you to install Java JDK version 6, Eclipse Juno 4.2 and Google Plugin for Eclipse, which will contain the latest App Engine Java SDK 1.7.4 (December Release). All the instructions for download are there in the document, including verifying that your setup is good.
 - `App Engine Dev Environment Setup.pdf` : Ignore this document since it contains instructions for setup if you attend the Workshop in person. 
 - `HelloWorld.pdf`: Follow the instructions here to write a Hello World application using Google App Engine Java and how to deploy your application to the Google Cloud. 
 - `ExamResults-Step-*`: There are a series of documents here that you need to follow step by step and preferably in order. All of these documents are referenced from the Presentation. So go through the presentation and it will tell you at the right time, which document to refer to complete the hands-on exercise.
- `hands-on-exercises/Exam Results App`: This folder contains several projects. Each of these projects are for a specific step in the workshop and are Eclipse projects that you can directly import. They are referenced in the above PDF documents and as you go through the PDF, it will tell you at the right time, when you import the project into Eclipse, so that you can study the code. 

**Note**

My development environment consisted of the following software:

- `Eclipse Juno` 
- `Google Eclipse Plugin (ADT) for Juno`
- `App Engine Java SDK 1.7.4`
